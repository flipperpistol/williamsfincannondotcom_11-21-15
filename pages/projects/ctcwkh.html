    	<div class="project_about"> It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing. Go ahead, touch the cornballer. If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray. First I blow him, then I poke him. My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer.</div>
